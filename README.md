## 🎯 What are Trace Tables?

Trace tables are a fundamental concept in computer science education, used to track the execution of algorithms step by step. Students fill in variable values and outputs as the program executes, helping them understand program flow and logic.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Vite** for fast development and building with SWC
- **TanStack React Router** for file-based routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible component primitives
- **Vitest** with Testing Library for comprehensive testing
- **Biome** for fast linting and formatting

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/domluther/TraceTablePractice.git
cd TraceTablePractice
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose from Easy, Medium, Hard or A-Level programs
2. **Pick a Program**: Browse available OCR ERL programs with descriptions
3. **Fill the Trace Table**: 
   - Enter line numbers where variables change
   - Fill in variable values at each step
   - Record any output produced
4. **Mark Your Answer**: Get instant feedback on your solution
5. **Track Progress**: View your statistics and level up!

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter` - Mark your answer
- `N` - Next program
- `P` - Previous program  
- `S` - Shuffle inputs (get new test data)

## 🧠 Supported OCR ERL Features

### Core Language Features
- ✅ Variables and assignment
- ✅ Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `MOD`, `DIV`)
- ✅ String operations and concatenation
- ✅ Input/Output (`input()`, `print()`)
- ✅ Type conversion (`int()`, `str()`, `float()`, `real()`)

### Control Structures  
- ✅ If-then-else statements
- ✅ While loops
- ✅ For loops (with optional step)
- ✅ Do-until loops

- ✅ Constants (`const`)
- ✅ Random number generation
- ✅ Comments (`//`)

## 📊 Scoring System

The application features a comprehensive scoring system with:

- **Points**: Earned for correct answers (varies by difficulty)
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct answers
- **Levels**: Progress through titles like "Trace Trainee" → "Algorithm Ace"
- **Persistent Progress**: Scores saved locally in your browser
